## Project 1: Navigation
# Collecting Bananas with DQN

## Introduction

The project teaches a DQN in a banana-collecting environment. The agent navigates in an environment to collect yellow
bananas while avoiding black ones. 
A trained agent may act like this example: 

![Trained Agent][image1]

A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana.  Thus, the goal of your agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.  

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions.  Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:
- **`0`** - move forward.
- **`1`** - move backward.
- **`2`** - turn left.
- **`3`** - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Getting Started

1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)

2. Extract the files into the root folder. If used in non-linux 64 bit environment, change the path in the navigation*.py files in the following line:


        env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana_Linux/Banana.x86_64")

Optional: Use Anaconda to install the 'pytorch' environment 

        conda env create -f environment.yml
        conda activate pytorch 
        
3. Use the setup.py to install dependencies in your favorite python distribution and/or environment


        pip install .

4. Train or watch the pretrained agent with the arguments in the file dqn/arguments.py by executing in folder dqn


        python train.py will train an agent with the parameters configured in arguments.py
        python watch.py   will show a preconfigured agent with a score of 15
        python train_policy_search.py will use policy search hillclimbing to optimize the policy in arguments.py
        
The policy needs to be then updated manually based on the results of hillclimbing. 
The hillclimb can be configured in PolicySearch.py 

# Concept of Reinforcement learning: 

Reinforcement learning means an agent learns to interact with an environment. At each time step, the agent bases an action 
on an perceived state of the environment. The environment provides a reward. The agent thus tries to maximize the 
expected reward. 
This expected reward is discounted, because awards in the future are less valuable and certain. 
The function mapping a state to an action is the policy. It can be either deterministic or stochastic. A stochastic 
policy computes probabilities from which the actions will be sampled. 
Value-based methods use a value function to map the value of each state. Alternatively, action-value functions map the 
value of each value-action pair. By using the action with the highest value, the agent 
obtains a policy which maximizes the expected reward. 
A value function can be learned using monte carlo methods. A monte carlo methods samples many trajectories 
and uses the received rewards to learn the value of each state and the actions. 
A TD-method does not wait for an entire episode to be completed. The current q-value table is used to estimate the 
next value after each action. This means, the value iteration is quicker, but also that rough estimated value tables lead to error propagation. 
A Monte Carlo Iteration is therefore not biased,whereas a TD-Method can learn faster. 
Both methods can use random actions or a greedy strategy to obtain new episodes. Mostly, a epsilon greedy approach is used, in 
which greedy reward-maximizing actions are mixed with random actions for exploration.  
Both methods are originally optimized for small state-action spaces, because they 
are built around q-tables storing each state value in a table. 
Continous state-spaces therefore need discretization methods. 
These discretization methods introduce a lot of human expert knowledge, and it is kind of 
obvious that they can be optimized with automated approaches. 
Machine learning inherently provides methods to automatically divide continous spaces (for example CNN layers), 
therefore deep-q-learning substitutes the q-table with a neural network. 
The q-learning algorithm is based on the q-table [algorithm sarsamax](https://github.com/jensakut/Reinforced-Taxi-Value-Iteration).
In Sarsamax, the value of executing an action in a specific state is estimated by looking into the q-table of the 
next state. The question now is: how to derive the value of the next state? In Monte Carlo Method, this value is derived
by analyzing the entire episode at once, therefore the "true" value is used to train. 
In TD-Learning, the next value is estimated by estimating the value with the same q-table that is trained. Therefore, 
the target value of the state, action pair is estimated as follows. 

        q_target(state, action) = discount * (reward + value(next_state, greedy_action))

The locally stored value in the q-table is corrected with the experienced state-action-reward-state tuple and 
a learning rate alpha: 
        
        q_local = q_table(state, action)
        q_table(state, action) = q_local + alpha * (q_target - q_local)

The value is iterated with itself. This is inherently instable and biased. Contrary to that, in monte-carlo estimation, 
the rewards are collected in total and then the episode is analyzed in it's entirety. 

In Deep-Q-Learning, this inherent instability is mitigated with the following main concepts: 
- Experience Replay: Vanilla Online TD-Learning is temporally correlated. Each step results in immediate learning. 
Instead, the state, action, reward, next_state events are saved in memory and the training happens later (at k steps).
The experience buffer stores and reuses the tuples and many tuples are used to learn in batches, which is very efficient 
using matrices instead of single operations. 
Each learning step uses randomly sampled occasions so learning is temporally decoupled and the batch shows increased
representativeness of the underlying MDP. 
- Fixed Q targets. 
The local network is learning values that a different target network has estimated. Therefore, the formula above is 
decoupled into the following:


        q_target(state, action, target_network) = discount * (reward + value(next_state, target_network))
        q_local = q_table(state, action)
        q_table(state, action) = q_local + alpha * (q_target - q_local)

The Bellman equations for this are as follows:

With the two core concepts, deep-q-learning is able to play atari-games and solve this banana collection task! 




### Main improvement concepts of the vanilla dqn algorithm 


#### [Double DQN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.06461)

The value estimation of the next state can be overestimated. This happens, because only the maximum q-value of each 
noisy action is used. The idea of Double Q-learning is to reduce overestimations by decomposing the max operation in 
the target into action selection and action evaluation. Although not fully decoupled, the target network in the DQN 
architecture provides a natural candidate for the second value function, without having to introduce additional 
networks. It is therefore proposed to evaluate the greedy policy  according to the online network, but using the target 
network to estimate its value.

#### [Prioritized experience replay](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.05952)

Prioritized experience replay gives priority to experiences with a big loss. These high-loss experiences get sampled for 
new learning more often. This introduced bias needs to be mitigated especially in the late stages of training. Therefore
the paper suggests to compensate the bias by learning less fast from these high-loss samples. At the end of learning, 
this bias needs high or full compensation. 

#### [Dueling DQN (DDQN)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581)
The core idea is to estimate state-value functions v(s) and the advantage of each action seperately and combine them
into an output. The beauty of this algorithm is that it only changes the network architecture and can be combined 
neatly into the dqn architecture with addons. 

![Dueling](assets/dueling.png?raw=true "Dueling")

#### [Asynchronous Methods for Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01783)
        
        
        "We propose a conceptually simple and lightweight framework for deep reinforcement learning that uses 
        asynchronous gradient descent for optimization of deep neural network controllers. We present asynchronous 
        variants of four standard reinforcement learning algorithms and show that parallel actor-learners have a 
        stabilizing effect on training allowing all four methods to successfully train neural network controllers. 
        The best performing method, an asynchronous variant of actor-critic, surpasses the current state-of-the-art 
        on the Atari domain while training for half the time on a single multi-core CPU instead of a GPU. Furthermore, 
        we show that asynchronous actor-critic succeeds on a wide variety of continuous motor control problems as 
        well as on a new task of navigating random 3D mazes using a visual input. "

#### [A Distributional Perspective on Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887)


        "In this paper we argue for the fundamental importance of the value distribution: the distribution of the random 
        return received by a reinforcement learning agent. This is in contrast to the common approach to reinforcement 
        learning which models the expectation of this return, or value. Although there is an established body of 
        literature studying the value distribution, thus far it has always been used for a specific purpose such as 
        implementing risk-aware behaviour. We begin with theoretical results in both the policy evaluation and control 
        settings, exposing a significant distributional instability in the latter. We then use the distributional 
        perspective to design a new algorithm which applies Bellman's equation to the learning of approximate value 
        distributions. We evaluate our algorithm using the suite of games from the Arcade Learning Environment. We 
        obtain both state-of-the-art results and anecdotal evidence demonstrating the importance of the value 
        distribution in approximate reinforcement learning. Finally, we combine theoretical and empirical evidence to 
        highlight the ways in which the value distribution impacts learning in the approximate setting."
        
#### [Noisy Networks for Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295)
        
        
        "We introduce NoisyNet, a deep reinforcement learning agent with parametric noise added to its weights, and 
        show that the induced stochasticity of the agent's policy can be used to aid efficient exploration. The 
        parameters of the noise are learned with gradient descent along with the remaining network weights. NoisyNet is 
        straightforward to implement and adds little computational overhead. We find that replacing the conventional 
        exploration heuristics for A3C, DQN and dueling agents (entropy reward and Ïµ-greedy respectively) with 
        NoisyNet yields substantially higher scores for a wide range of Atari games, in some cases advancing the 
        agent from sub to super-human performance."
        

#### [Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298)
        
        
        "The deep reinforcement learning community has made several independent improvements to the DQN algorithm. 
        However, it is unclear which of these extensions are complementary and can be fruitfully combined. This 
        paper examines six extensions to the DQN algorithm and empirically studies their combination. Our experiments 
        show that the combination provides state-of-the-art performance on the Atari 2600 benchmark, both in terms of 
        data efficiency and final performance. We also provide results from a detailed ablation study that shows the 
        contribution of each component to overall performance."

# Report 

The repository contains the following algorithms with optimized parameters
- Vanilla DQN 
- Double DQN 
- Dueling DQN
- Prioritized experience replay with a Sum Tree 
Each algorithm can be switched off and on individually. To help understanding, the interested reader can search for the 
occurrence of these switches and learn about their effect on the overall DQN architecture. 


## Model 
The Double DQN uses a simple network architecture exhibiting fully
 connected layers. This simple architecture is suitable to learn the required 
 Q_values without a lot of data. 
 The dqn_model_test loads the dqn network and prints the nodes. 

  (fc1): Linear(in_features=37, out_features=64, bias=True)
  (fc2): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=64, bias=True)
  (fc3): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=4, bias=True)
  (state_value): Linear(in_features=64, out_features=1, bias=True)

The activation functions are relu and as Adam Optimizer was chosen. 

## Parameters

The following parameters help the network to learn fast. It is interesting to note 
that the Epsilon decays faster and the learning rate is higher to boost fast learning of a 
relatively simple task. 

The parameters from the Atari Papers work well. With the small network, a score of 13 is achieved in 550 episodes. 
The parameters from the prioritized experience replay are: 
Learning rate 1e-4, learn every 4 steps from 32 episodes. If the agent learns every 16 steps from 256 episodes, the 
steps are fewer, but the episodes are faster due to the usage of a graphics card with enough memory.  
The average score is improved from 14.3 to 15 in fewer episodes.

### Improved parameters with manual search

A faster training can be achieved using the following parameters: 
### Experience Buffer 10000
Since the learning is quick, the experience buffer is smaller, because older examples 
do not represent the quickly adapted policy that well. 
 
### n_episodes 700
The network overfits beyond 700, indicated by reduced scores. The useful number of episodes varies greatly among the parameters. 
Basically if the network does not improve or substantially (more than 2 points from max) decreases, training is futile. 

### Epsilon 
Only a small epsilon guarantuees high scores because the random parameters are  typically non-optimal actions. Technically
the skill of a learned agent should be evaluated with epsilon = 0. 
- eps_start=1.0
- eps_min=0.01
- eps_decay=0.99

### Learning parameters
The batch size in combination with the update_every parameter shows how often experience is reused on average. 
In the current implementation 256 batch size does not cost a lot of extra time since the network is small. Learning at 
every 16 step means that the average experience is reused 8 times. The achievable score improves with bigger batches 
and faster learning events. 
- BATCH_SIZE = 256  A large minibatch size stabilizes the learning parameters
- UPDATE_EVERY = 16  # how often to update the network
- BUFFER_SIZE = int(1e3)  # replay buffer size

The discount factor gamma shows how far into the future the lookahead shows. The halftime of 0.99 is ~ 70 steps, so 
the agent roughly overlooks the entire episode of 300 steps weighing a step 2*70 ahead with 25 %. 

- GAMMA = 0.99  The discount factor shows how much importance future expectand reward has

The soft update of the target parameters shows how far ahead the local network is from the target network. If this 
parameter is too big, it destabilizes learning.  
- TAU = 1e-2  # for soft update of target parameters

Using double-dqn, a learning rate of 1e-3 is better, for prioritized experience replay 1e-4 is showing better results. 
- LR = 1e-3  # learning rate. 



Achieved score

The environment is solved in ~300 episodes with an average score of 100 episodes above 13. After 400 Episodes, 
a score of 15 is achieved. 
This run uses double and dueling algorithms as well as the above parameters with a small 64, 64 neural network. 
The watch.py file uses the weights obtained at episode 400 of this run.

The best run using Prioritized experience Replay is shown in the following diagram. The weighting factors for using 
PER are 0.4 in order to achieve a high score. 
The learning rate is set to 1e-4 in contrast to the above implementation with 1e-3. The batch_size is increased to 512
and the experience buffer is tripled to 2^15 (a number beneficial for the sum tree).

# Policy search 

Currently the policy search samples a trajectory based on the configured parameters in arguments.py. These arguments
are randomly altered and a training trajectory is rolled out. 

Hill Climbing

Hill climbing is an iterative algorithm that can be used to find the weights Î¸ for an optimal policy.
By slightly perturbing the values of the current best estimate for the weights Î¸best, 
a new set of weights is yielded. These new weights are then used to collect an episode. If the new weights 
Î¸new resulted in higher return than the old weights, then Î¸new is set as the new Î¸best.


## Random altering
The trajectory gets rated according to max average score and the average score overall. This favors an algorithm that 
achieves a high score and learns fast. 
The best rated trajectory is modified randomly according to a predefined set of parameters to be sampled from. The idea
stems from the PER paper, which gives reasonable ranges for parameters. The parameters are based on typical parameter 
ranges. 
For each step, the best known parameter set gets mutated. 

In Hillclimbing, parameters get changed by a small offset. But this approach does not account for the parameters
to be optimized here, which sometimes can vary in factors of 10 or 100. Therefore, two parameters get sampled randomly. 
Previously sampled trajectories get rejected, because the computational time is too high. 

## Data analysis

Each run gets logged with an matplotlib-diagram, a csv and a yaml. 
The image shows the learnign progress in a representative way. 
The csv and yaml show similar data, but sometimes 
a quick look into a csv spreadsheet is nice. 
The logged data also show the trajectories of characteristic values to allow for post-analysis in detail. 

Currently, the alternated parameters are: 'learning_rate', 'fc1', 'fc2', 'annihilation_lengths', 'alpha', 'beta_start',
                                'batch_size', 'epsilon_decay', 'tau', 'update_every', 'per_eps', 'buffer_size'

# Potential improvements

Then, it would be very interesting to use saliency maps and the visual simulator to further analyze the algorithmic 
performance and fallacies. 

Watching the agent, a more capable neural network could improve the behavior in the environment.
